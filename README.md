# Polyphony (Legacy)

**THIS IS NOT THE 1.18 IN-DEVELOPMENT VERSION OF THE PACK!** To see the actual final version of this pack in development, please go to https://github.com/PolyphonyModpack/Polyphony

This is a permanently-beta version of Polyphony that I'm using to experiment in pack design for 1.12 in the meantime. The repository will contain various scripts that add neat processing lines for various mods in 1.12 (See MODLIST.md for details).
